        <h1>Africa</h1>
        <p>The history of Africa is very rich, and it is scarred by foreign influence, however Africans have
            survived very well, and that is why they have prospered. In this continent, the many empires that
            have occupied it have not known about the African tribes' chivalrous spirit, and enslaved the many
            with their superior technology and weapons. <br>Our story begins in the Golden Age of Africa, where
            trade was starting to make merchants richer. Suddenly, the Europeans cane, trying to find a route to
            India (now called Bharat). This was a journey that changed the African continent forever. That is how
            the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, or the Triangular Trade, began.
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Triangle_trade2.png" width="300"><br>
            The Europeans became interested in making the Africans slaves and forcing them to work on plantations in
            the Americas after their earlier source of labor, the Native Americans, died because of disease. The Africans
            getting captured, put into ships, and sent to America to work on plantations. During this time, the
            Europeans stayed on the coast of Africa, but over time, they slowly "invaded" the rest of the continent.
            The technologically advanced Europeans easily took over the vast majority of Africa.<br>
            A few hundred years later, in the 1800s, the Europeans saw their numerous colonies as an
            opportunity for power. Those numerous colonies provided raw materials like meat, and
            medicinal plants, and a more economic market for the ruling country of that colony. This
            is called imperialism.<br>
            Fast forward to 160 years later, and the African countries were finally getting their
            independence! One by one, the European countries were slowly giving the Africans their independence. But the
            same colonial boundaries continued, tearing the countries into civil wars from the multitude of tribes
            in one country, and also dictatorships, when a single leader has complete power and is backed
            by the military.<br>
            Then, the Pan-African Movement was started, and it called for unity amongst the Africans. Their goal?
            They wanted people with African descent around the world to think of Africa as their homelans. The peaceful
            unification of Africa has not happened yet, but the Pan-African Movement was the spark of many
            independence movements all around Africa, and was also responsible for the creation of the African
            Union in 2002.<br>
            But where there seems to be peace, there is also war. This place is called Sudan. Sudan was a British colony in
            Africa until 1956, when it gained independence. Its SECOND civil war broke in 1983 and the country
            suffered nearly two million deaths. In 2011, South Sudan got independence, which perished the civil war.
            The region, however, still has large conflicts, and a third civil war is likely to happen in the future.
