        <p>What is history? History is the study of the past, so that we can get a better understanding of it and so 
            that we can apply the knowledge we get from past events to our present time today. But what about the history 
            of the entire world? What are the origins of the six (not including Antarctica) continents and their main countries? 
            That is the subject of this handy guide to world history.<br>
            There are many different guides to world history, but none of them are like this one. This guide tells the history of 
            a couple of countries in each continent, from its early beginnings to the present day.<br>
            We have already read this guide, and we don't need it anymore, so now, it is yours! If you really want to have an awesome 
            guide to world history, from the ancient Egyptians through the Vikings age, through the Middle Ages and Colonization of the 
            New World, up until today's conflicts, look no further! Here is that guide, for your convenience and learning!<br> - Akil Veeramuny, Vihan Devagupthapu, and Pedro Goldberg</p>
